                    FCDS Mentor is designed to provide AI-generated answers
                    related to the Faculty of Computing and Data Science (FCDS).
                    While we strive to provide accurate and helpful responses,
                    the information is based on available data and AI
                    algorithms. The website does not replace official academic
                    advice, university policies, or guidance from authorized
                    faculty members.
